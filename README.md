# About and Why

This is a replica of the famous game 2048, written in TS using a React framework and a tiny Express server. I chose this exersise beacuse of its graphical simplicity and because its mechanics posed an intruiging problem. 

### What am I happy about
Very happy with the way the game engine handles the directions of movement using differently oriented 2D arrays. The code came out leaner than anticipated. 


## Changes
### 2/8/20

- Added score-keeping functionality.

### 2/7/20
- Pushed initial code to GH.
- Game functioning with no win / lose conditions
